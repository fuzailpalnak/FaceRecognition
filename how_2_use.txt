#LIBRARIES NEEDED
-dlib
-opencv 2.4
-wx (if you want to run the video application)
-sklearn

once you install these lib check for following files

-shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
-dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat

you will find the above files in  params folder in my git repo

how to generate_data_and_labels the model
Files needed to generate_data_and_labels model-createpickle.py , known_people_scan.py  ,Facedetection.py

1-there is a folder called knownfaces which has folder wise images of user (so now there are only 4 users )
  if you wish to add add more user create a folder with name of user  in knownfaces folder and add images in the newly created folder
  for example if you want to add yourself ,you will create a folder new folder with your name prakhar in knownfaces and add all images to new folder ..
  thats all to adding new users in folder
  Note image name doest while storing ,just remember to give the folder name correctly coz that name will go in your classification output

2-after creating folder just add the new folder name to (known_faces = ["amyadams", "chadsmith","islafisher","willferrell"]) in create pickle file which is
  on line 26  and give the folder path in get_files method in createpickle.py

#Note -make sure to add shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat  and dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat in params folder

After all these is completed run the createpickle.py which will create trained svm model in params folder which will complete your training


prediction

you will need check_on_photos.py  and FaceDetection.py

then just run check_on_photos.py to get prediction
